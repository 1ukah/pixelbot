## How It Works

The bot scans the screen for specific pixel patterns and performs actions based on the detected patterns. This involves capturing the screen, analyzing pixel data, and executing predefined actions when certain patterns are found. Additionally, the bot has input handlers that allow it to send mouse and keyboard inputs, enabling it to interact with the screen programmatically.

## Features

- Automates tasks by detecting specific pixel patterns on the screen.
- Sends mouse and keyboard inputs using built-in input handlers.
