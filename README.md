## * ! WARNING ! *
## There's a lot of bad/scuffed stuff in here!

I initially made this for me and some friends use while we were playing on a minecraft rankup server, it was intended to buy things from the server's market automatically and to have a simple auto-clicker. But then we stopped playing and I didn't see any purpose for this anymore.
I don't feel this is worth the time getting back and fixing all the scuffed stuff that I did, so yeah... Let's throw this here and forget about it!
